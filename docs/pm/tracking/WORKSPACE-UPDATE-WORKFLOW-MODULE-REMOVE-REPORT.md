# Workspace Update Workflow Module Remove Report

**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Task:** Remove "Update Workflow" module from workspace page
**Status:** ❌ CANNOT FIND TARGET

---

## Summary

Extensive search was conducted to find and remove the "Update Workflow" module from the workspace page. **No such module or feature was found in the codebase.**

---

## Phase 1: Search for "Update Workflow" Module

### Files Checked:
1. ✅ `src/app/(protected)/workspace/page.tsx` - Main workspace page
2. ✅ `src/components/workspaces/WorkspaceManager.tsx` - Workspace manager component
3. ✅ `src/components/workflows/WorkflowSelector.tsx` - Workflow selector component
4. ✅ `src/components/workflows/WorkflowsCard.tsx` - Workflows card component
5. ✅ `src/components/workflows/WorkflowUpload.tsx` - Workflow upload component
6. ✅ `src/app/workspace/new/page.tsx` - New project page
7. ✅ `src/app/(protected)/project/[id]/page.tsx` - Project detail page

### Search Results:
- **No "Update Workflow" button found** in any of the above files
- **No "update workflow" text found** in UI components
- **No "更新工作流" text found** in UI components

---

## Phase 2: Current Workspace Page Content

The current workspace page (`src/app/(protected)/workspace/page.tsx`) has the following quick actions:

1. **New Project** - Creates a new workspace project, navigates to `/workspace/new`
2. **Upload Workflow** - Uploads a workflow as a template
3. **技能提取** (Skill Builder) - Links to `/skill-builder`
4. **更多功能** (More Features) - Disabled, shows "敬请期待" (Coming Soon)

### Project Manager Section:
The `WorkspaceManager` component displays:
- List of existing projects
- "New Project" button in the header
- "Delete Project" button on each project
- No "Update Workflow" button

---

## Phase 3: Search for Recent Changes

### Git History:
- Checked recent commits to workspace page
- Found removal of `TemplateSelect` component in uncommitted changes
- **No commits mentioning "Update Workflow" feature**

### Uncommitted Changes:
- `TemplateSelect` component was removed (unrelated to "Update Workflow")
- Project creation now navigates to `/workspace/new` instead of using `TemplateSelect`

---

## Phase 4: Search in Documentation

### Documentation Files Checked:
1. `docs/pm/PM_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` - Mentions "更新工作流程" (update workflow process) but refers to team process, not UI
2. `docs/pm/tracking/*.md` - No mention of "Update Workflow" UI feature

### Search Keywords:
- "Update Workflow"
- "update workflow"
- "更新工作流"
- "Update Workflow 按钮" (Update Workflow button)
- "Update Workflow 模块" (Update Workflow module)

### Results:
- **No documentation found about an "Update Workflow" UI feature**

---

## Phase 5: Possible Misunderstandings

###可能性 1 (Possibility 1): PM meant "Upload Workflow"
- There IS an "Upload Workflow" button on the workspace page
- However, PM explicitly stated: "移除的不是'工作流市场'按钮，要移除的是 'Update Workflow' 这个模块/按钮"
- This suggests PM knows the difference between buttons

###可能性 2 (Possibility 2): PM meant "TemplateSelect" Component
- `TemplateSelect` component was recently removed in uncommitted changes
- However, this was for selecting templates, not "updating" workflows
- Component name doesn't match "Update Workflow"

###可能性 3 (Possibility 3): Feature Never Existed
- "Update Workflow" feature may have been planned but never implemented
- PM might be referring to a feature that was never built

---

## Phase 6: Current State Verification

The workspace page currently works correctly:
- ✅ Can create new projects
- ✅ Can upload workflows
- ✅ Can navigate to skill builder
- ✅ Can view and manage existing projects
- ✅ Can delete projects

No "Update Workflow" button or module exists to remove.

---

## Conclusion

**RECOMMENDATION:** Clarify with PM what "Update Workflow" module they are referring to. Possible scenarios:

1. **Feature Never Existed:** The "Update Workflow" module may have been planned but never implemented.

2. **Different Terminology:** PM might be referring to a different button with a different name (e.g., "Upload Workflow", "TemplateSelect").

3. **Future Feature:** PM might be asking to remove a feature that was never implemented yet.

4. **Miscommunication:** There might be confusion about what needs to be removed.

---

## Additional Notes

### Similar Features Found:
- **Upload Workflow:** Button that allows uploading workflows as templates
- **TemplateSelect (REMOVED):** Component for selecting workflow templates (already removed in uncommitted changes)
- **Workflow Market:** Separate page at `/market/workflows` (NOT on workspace page, PM said NOT to remove this)

### API Endpoints Found (Backend Only):
- `PATCH /api/workflows/[id]` - Update workflow spec properties
- This is a backend API endpoint, not a UI button/module
